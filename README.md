# Python does not have function overloading in the traditional sense like some other languages (e.g., C++, Java).

Function overloading allows you to define multiple functions with the same name but different argument lists.

## Why No Function Overloading in Python?

Dynamic Typing: Python is a dynamically typed language, meaning variable types are determined at runtime. This makes it difficult for the interpreter to distinguish between functions with the same name but different argument types.

Focus on Readability: Python emphasizes writing clear and readable code. Function overloading can sometimes lead to confusion if multiple functions with the same name exist.

Alternatives Exist: Python provides alternative mechanisms to achieve similar functionality:

Default Arguments: You can define functions with default values for some arguments. This allows you to have a single function that works with different numbers of arguments.
Keyword Arguments (\*\*kwargs): Functions can accept a dictionary (dict) argument to handle additional arguments beyond the explicitly defined positional parameters. This allows for flexibility in the number and type of arguments passed.
Type Hints (Optional): While not enforced at runtime, type hints can improve code readability and provide documentation for your functions.
Here's an example comparing function overloading in another language (C++) with Python's alternative approaches:

### C++ (Function Overloading):

`void print(int value); void print(const char\* message);`

### Python (Alternatives):

`def print_value(value):print(value)`

`def print_message(message="Hello, world!"):print(message)`

`def print_anything(\*\*kwargs): for key, value in kwargs.items():print(f"{key}: {value}")`

## In summary:

Python prioritizes readability and flexibility over function overloading.
Default arguments, keyword arguments, and type hints offer effective alternatives for function customization and handling different argument scenarios.

## Achieving Overloading-like Behavior:

While Python doesn't have true function overloading, you can use default arguments to create a single function that behaves differently based on the arguments provided. However, there are limitations:

1. Argument Order Matters: Unlike function overloading, the order of arguments in Python remains important. You cannot have a function that takes two positional arguments with default values, and then call it with only one argument in the middle (e.g., add(5, None) wouldn't work).
2. Limited Flexibility: Overloading allows for more variation in argument types and combinations, whereas default arguments are primarily used for setting optional values within a fixed argument structure.

# The @property

is a built-in decorator for the property() function in Python. It is used to give "special" functionality to certain methods to make them act as getters, setters, or deleters when we define properties in a class.
